A Simple Pattern Library
========

Pattern and snippet libraries are becoming a valuable part of the front-end development process. For larger projects with many participants, it's useful to build large frameworks that require pre-processing and server-side languages, but I often find them to be overkill for my needs.

Hence: A Simple Pattern Library.

## Some Cool Stuff

1. Fully front end. (Pre-processor and server-side laguage free.)
2. jQuery is used to enhance the page (auto-generating the nav and code snippets), but the page works jsut fine without JS.
3. Smooth-scrolling anchor links; auto-highlighting nav elements.

## Some Shortcomings

1. It's fluid, but not responsive yet.
2. The nav, when overflowing, does not auto-scroll to the selected item.
3. item titles aren't links yet (so you don't have to hunt in the nav for a link)
